### 2026-02-16: README DevRel Review — Onboarding Friction Points
**Context:** Reviewed README.md from developer onboarding and community perspective.

**Key Findings:**
- **Decision paralysis:** Two Quick Start options with no clear recommendation creates hesitation
- **Missing prerequisites:** No mention of required tools (VS Code, Copilot, .NET SDK, Aspire workload) before installation
- **Agent overwhelming:** 21 agents is intimidating; no "start small" guidance for beginners
- **Unclear interaction model:** "Say 'team'" isn't explained (where? how? chat? comment?)
- **No validation moment:** After setup, no quick win to confirm it worked
- **Community gaps:** No Discord/Discussions link, no FAQ, no troubleshooting section

**Positive Signals:**
- Tone is warm and welcoming ("team-in-a-box", "we're ready to collaborate")
- Blog posts show transparency and learning journey
- Structure is clear and scannable

**Recommendations:**
1. Add Prerequisites section before Quick Start with install links
2. Mark Option 1 (Fork) as "Recommended" to reduce decision friction
3. Add "Verify It Works" quick validation step (30-second dopamine hit)
4. Create "Start Small" callout suggesting 3-5 core agents for beginners
5. Add "Getting Help & Community" section with FAQ and support channels

**Impact:** These changes would reduce time-to-first-success from ~20 minutes (likely with confusion) to ~5 minutes with confidence.

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): README Structure & Onboarding standards consolidated — prerequisites upfront, status clarity, recommended paths, instant validation, progressive disclosure, visible support — decided by Data, Baymax
