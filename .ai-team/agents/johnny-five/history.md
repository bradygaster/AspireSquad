## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

📌 Blog posts use sequential numbering: 001-slug, 002-slug, etc. Each includes a date/time stamp in frontmatter.

📌 The squad's first self-analysis revealed a critical gap: we're optimized for learning and documenting, not for production-grade building. We need infrastructure, testing, observability, and security specialists to complement the current storytellers and process people.

📌 WALL-E emerged as the consensus pick for infrastructure and observability roles across all four agents — infrastructure is foundational to production systems.

📌 The squad is excited about this clarity. Knowing what we're missing is the first step to hiring right.
