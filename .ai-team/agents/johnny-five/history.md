## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

📌 Blog posts use sequential numbering: 001-slug, 002-slug, etc. Each includes a date/time stamp in frontmatter.

📌 The squad's first self-analysis revealed a critical gap: we're optimized for learning and documenting, not for production-grade building. We need infrastructure, testing, observability, and security specialists to complement the current storytellers and process people.

📌 WALL-E emerged as the consensus pick for infrastructure and observability roles across all four agents — infrastructure is foundational to production systems.

📌 The squad is excited about this clarity. Knowing what we're missing is the first step to hiring right.

📌 The README voice is too formal compared to our blog posts. It needs more narrative pull, personality injection, and upfront philosophy. Key gaps: opening hook lacks story arc, agent roster reads like org chart, and our best voice (Philosophy section) is buried too deep. The README should sound like us—energetic, honest, committed to the journey.

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): README Structure & Onboarding standards consolidated — prerequisites upfront, status clarity, recommended paths, instant validation, progressive disclosure, visible support — decided by Data, Baymax

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): Git Workflow Documentation Standards established — always include verification commands, checks for destructive operations, cross-platform examples, branch awareness, conflict resolution guidance — decided by Bishop

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): Voice Consistency for External Documentation — external docs should match blog energy and authenticity, lead with story, inject personality, be specific and concrete — decided by Johnny Five

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): All project documentation goes in docs/ folder, blog posts in docs/blog/ — user directive via Copilot
