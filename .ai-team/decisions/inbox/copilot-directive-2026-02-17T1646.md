### 2026-02-17: Branding, docs, and versioning overhaul
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot, feedback from Maddy and team)
**What:** Three mandatory changes across all team content:
1. Replace all instances of ".NET Aspire" with "Aspire" — this is the current branding
2. All documentation references must prioritize aspire.dev over learn.microsoft.com
3. Update all technical content to reflect Aspire 9 (latest GA release)
4. Remove outdated "workload" references — the workload concept is long gone
5. Take an aggressive approach to modernization — both technical and marketing language
**Why:** Team feedback from Maddy — content was stale and using old branding/terminology
